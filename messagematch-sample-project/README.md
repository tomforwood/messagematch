# messagematch-sample-project

This project exists to test, not to actually run - it won't start because the non-mock wirings don't exist

It provides some simple REST style enpoints and provides a messagematch based test for *one* of them
The fact that the other is untested should show up using code coverage based tools

It also has a redundant unused test spec, which moreover does not match the OpenApi spcification it is supposed to

This results in errors in the maven build
