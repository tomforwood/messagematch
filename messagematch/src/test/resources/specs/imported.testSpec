# This is a test spec theoretically imported from another project via classpath
# This project is going to use the call UnderTest part as a sideEffect spec
# The side effects specified in this file are irrelevant from out point of view
# i.e. The code under test is going to call /myOtherTest with the given request and expects to get back the response message
# This helps to tie the behaviour we expect from /myOtherTest to the behaviour that has actually been tested for myOtherTest
